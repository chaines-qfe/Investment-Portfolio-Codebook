# Investment-Portfolio-Codebook
Semester long project managing an investment portfolio, with analysis performed in MATLAB. 

I completed this project as part of the Credential in Quantative Finanical Economics (QFE) program at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2017. 

More information about the program is available at: qfe.web.unc.edu. 

Please note this MATLAB code will no longer compile, because it relies on an expired license to Money.net in order to obtain financial data. I have included the powerpoint presentation outputed by the code (the presentation was created entirely by the MATLAB file attached).
